# Tuwaiq_Final_Project

The danger of network security is becoming increasingly a threat to both individuals and companies. This may lead to attack of network system and exploit human sensitivity. Therefore, it is a high-level importance to protect network security against attacks including phishing emails. Thus, this project analyzes a dataset of 10000x50 shape and understand the relationships and correlation of features. This extends to the use of plots to visualize the dataset features and observations more distinctly. This is not limited to visualization and getting intuition about the dataset but also preprocessing data for null values and imbalanced/balanced dataset checking. The main objective of the final project is to create a suitable machine learning model to predict either a random email is phishing or benign. The tools used in this project are popular packages such as sklearn, NumPy and Pandas. The progress to reach the most suitable model is by trying different techniques and machine learning supervised algorithm. This includes linear, logistic regression, K-Nearest-Neighboring, Decision Tree, Random Forests and Neural Network.
